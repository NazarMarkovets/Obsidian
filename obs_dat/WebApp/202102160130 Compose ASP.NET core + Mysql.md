#WebApp #Csharp 

##### docker-compose.yml
```docker
version: '3.4'
services:
 myskyl: 
 image: mysql:latest
 environment: 
 MYSQL\_ROOT\_PASSWORD: "password"
 ports: 
 - "3306:3306"

 tst:
 build: .
 ports: 
 - "8080:80"
```

Last step - change connection string for C#

##### It was
```dotnet
ConnectionString \= @"server=localhost;port=3306;database=comments;userid=root;password=password;";
```


##### It is now
```dotnet
ConnectionString \= @"server=myskyl;port=3306;database=comments;userid=root;password=password;";
```

Name `myskyl` must be the same;

Then:


##### run docker compose
```docker
docker-compose build
...
docker-compose up
....
```
After that: 
Connect to database and check the data by usual select query;
OR
Create database, table and data

ERROR:
System.Data.DataException: Can not execute read request. Place:

It means that there is no data to select. Container with data has no rows
